# Wine-Quality-Prediction

I successfully developed a machine learning model to classify wine quality based on its chemical properties, implementing critical steps such as data pre-processing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and training a Random Forest classifier. This project enhanced prediction accuracy through model optimization, provided valuable insights into the features most influencing wine quality, and ensured data integrity by addressing missing values and outliers. Leveraging skills in Python and libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, I efficiently handled data manipulation, visualization, and modelling. This work demonstrates my ability to create impactful machine learning solutions and gain actionable insights from complex datasets.
